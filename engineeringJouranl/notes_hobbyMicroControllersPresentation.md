### Outline

**Set up the issue** You have ideas [for your MVP], but they imply devices - devices which don't exist! Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to quickly prototype a new gadget?

**Present a solution** Arduino + Raspberry Pi + the rest

**Present some technical concepts** All of you already have a good foundation to program ES! Embedded C code

**Dazzle with image and video** 

**Put it into context with the professional ES world** you can't do everything with acessbile MCs like Arduino and rPi.

### Jokes

**Terminator Gag** Setup early with "you want to make their jaw drop" using the psychatrist in t2. Payoff late when showing all the things you can make, one demo will be a terminator!
