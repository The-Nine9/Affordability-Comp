	server/index.js lines about brotlicompression

Issue
	I downloaded + installed postgres from the webstie, but couldn't use common cli commands. I then downloaded postgress with brew, and installed with brew. Now I have the ability to run posgress cli commands, but on attempting to start the postgress service, I am getting an error message that the port is in use by another "postmaster" - the port number 5432 indicates to me that the new, homebrew-installed postgress service is conflicting with the original installation.
Theory
  I need to kill the existing postgres service.
Actions
	I did sudo rm -r on the postgres directory in /Library.
Result
	It looks like deleting that directory has allowed me to beign postgres with the postgres-init command I added to my bashrc. I'm going to continue working thru the tutorial @ https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8/

Issue
  The data in my csv appears backwards
Resolution
  Refactoring writeStrings() from a do-while to a for loop fixed this.

Issue
	The null values for HOA keys aren't printing
Resolution

Issue
	After running my properties() csv generation function, I got an error message about the JS heap running out of memory; see "sand/sed error 545am". Running the script with 1/100th the amount of records attempted resulted in success.
Theory
	I am attempting to do so much computing work, that my system can't handle it.
	I could increase the memory limit. 1.7GB standard?
	@ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38558989/node-js-heap-out-of-memory
  Set node environment variable
  $ node --max-old-space-size=4096 yourFile.js // this is 4gb, and was not enough
  $ node --max-old-space-size=7168 yourFile.js // try 7gb, still ran out
Resolution
	Signifigant refactoring with the team! 

Issue
	DataBase/psql/csvMaker.psql.js does not appear in git, at all!
Theory
	It has been gitignored somehow (negative!)
Resolution
	An attempt to get the file un-ignored by renmaing it revealed that git was tracking it, as it was recognized as a "deleted" file.
	I must have already commited all the recent changes? It's possible. I haven't been working on it for a while. ---> confirmed this by trying chaning a comment. It's up-to-date!
