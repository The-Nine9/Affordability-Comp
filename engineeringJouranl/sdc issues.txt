Issue:
	Fully understand the existing DB and its API
Theory:
	It very likely doesn't have that much
	Q: Only collection is for prices? What about agents + schedules schemas? they're unused schemas?
Resolution:
	dev mode for webpack
	server/index.js lines about brotlicompression

Issue
	attempting to run npm start, and i get "sh: nodemon: command not found"
Theory
	nodemon is not listed as a dependency in package.json
Resolution
	installed nodemon --> Listening on 

Issue
	attempting to run npm react-dev, error Algorithm "brotliCompress" is not found in "zlib"
Theory
	I need to install additional compression libraries
Resolution?
	Q for Blake?

Issue
	there is no apparent endpoint which would access the getAll() method from mongoCont, but the perteinent test passes anyways.
Theory
	I haven't found the endpoint yet
Resolution

Issue
	I downloaded + installed postgres from the webstie, but couldn't use common cli commands. I then downloaded postgress with brew, and installed with brew. Now I have the ability to run posgress cli commands, but on attempting to start the postgress service, I am getting an error message that the port is in use by another "postmaster" - the port number 5432 indicates to me that the new, homebrew-installed postgress service is conflicting with the original installation.
Theory
  I need to kill the existing postgres service.
Actions
	I did sudo rm -r on the postgres directory in /Library.
Result
	It looks like deleting that directory has allowed me to beign postgres with the postgres-init command I added to my bashrc. I'm going to continue working thru the tutorial @ https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8/

Issue
  The data in my csv appears backwards
Resolution
  Refactoring writeStrings() from a do-while to a for loop fixed this.

Issue
	The null values for HOA keys aren't printing
Resolution
	Switched from using null to represent no HOA, to using -1.

Issue
	After running my properties() csv generation function, I got an error message about the JS heap running out of memory; see "sand/sed error 545am". Running the script with 1/100th the amount of records attempted resulted in success.
Theory
	I am attempting to do so much computing work, that my system can't handle it.
	I could increase the memory limit. 1.7GB standard?
	@ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38558989/node-js-heap-out-of-memory
  Set node environment variable
  $ node --max-old-space-size=4096 yourFile.js // this is 4gb, and was not enough
  $ node --max-old-space-size=7168 yourFile.js // try 7gb, still ran out
Resolution
	Signifigant refactoring with the team! 

Issue
	DataBase/psql/csvMaker.psql.js does not appear in git, at all!
Theory
	It has been gitignored somehow (negative!)
Resolution
	An attempt to get the file un-ignored by renmaing it revealed that git was tracking it, as it was recognized as a "deleted" file.
	I must have already commited all the recent changes? It's possible. I haven't been working on it for a while. ---> confirmed this by trying chaning a comment. It's up-to-date!

Issue
	Some of my .csv files include the delimmitter character ","
Theory
	I can write a helper function to eliminate commas from strings
Resolution?
	I the helper function and attached it to to strings generated in my csv generator. It's cooking files now, we'll see if I get any errors when I go to copy csvs over into the db.

Issue
	Seeding my postgress db with my .csv files
Theory
	Either (a) seed with a script, or (b) use a psql-cli command
Resolution?
	Try (b) ---> @ https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-copy.html
	=> COPY table_name [column name, column name]
			FROM 

Issue:
	When copying from csv into my postgres db from the psql-cli, I encountered this data type error:
		mortgage=# COPY agents FROM '/Users/thomasbrannan/Desktop/hackReactor/SDC/Affordability-Comp/DataBase/psql/data/agents.csv';
		ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type integer: "name, title, rating, recentSales, phone, email, avatar, about, agency"
		CONTEXT:  COPY agents, line 1, column agent_id: "name, title, rating, recentSales, phone, email, avatar, about, agency"
	This looks like and issue with the agent_id field not auto-incrementing as I thought it would; notice that I do not insert on that field.
Theory
	a) modify my csv generators to insert on the id fields
	b) modify my psql schema to work the way I originally wanted it to
Resolution?
	Got an answer from Blake; persuing route (b) by modifying primary key declarations
		Wrong: client_id SERIAL NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(client_id),
		Right: client_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	After taking those actions, I recieved the same error.	
	Relevant Q @
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36368496/pg-copy-error-invalid-input-syntax-for-integer-when-importing-quoted-csv-file
	Specify the columns... 
		COPY agents (name, title, rating, recentSales, phone, email, avatar, about, agency) FROM '/Users/thomasbrannan/Desktop/hackReactor/SDC/Affordability-Comp/DataBase/psql/data/agents.csv';

Issue:
	Error: varchar size limits! Trying making every varchar 280 chars long (a tweet). Q
		@ stackoverflow.com/questions/25593338/how-to-import-tables-with-missing-values
Theory:
		Try adding an explicit delimiter to my query: maybe it doesn't recognize the columns in my csv, since it doesn't know to split on the ","?
			COPY agents (name, title, rating, recentSales, phone, email, avatar, about, agency) FROM '/Users/thomasbrannan/Desktop/hackReactor/SDC/Affordability-Comp/DataBase/psql/data/agents.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',';
		I have a space added to my columns in the header
			ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type integer: " rating"
			CONTEXT:  COPY agents, line 1, column rating: " rating"
		--> try eliminating spaces from query?
Resolution:
	Sean+Blake suggest CSV HEADER, also using WITH is optional:
		COPY agents (name,title,rating,recentSales,phone,email,avatar,about,agency) FROM '/Users/thomasbrannan/Desktop/hackReactor/SDC/Affordability-Comp/DataBase/psql/data/agents.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
	the error would make sense if itâ€™s perceiving the csv header as data, i.e. putting the string from the header into the integer field.

Issue:
	Attempted to run $node seed.psql.js.
	Got a very long error message: see "error_wed_610pm"
	"ERROR: must be a superuser or...", for all six tables
Theory:
	Add role to the seeder user
Resolution:
	Use psql cli ALTER ROLE
		a) make seeder a superuser? --> go for it
		b) give seeder limited privilege? --> may be complicated
	-# ALTER ROLE 
	--> superuser privilege for seeder got that fixed.
